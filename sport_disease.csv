37991553,Imaging of muscle injuries in soccer.,"Accurate diagnosis of muscle injuries is a challenge in everyday clinical practice and may have profound impact on the recovery and return-to-play decisions of professional athletes particularly in soccer. Imaging techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in addition to the medical history and clinical examination, make a significant contribution to the timely structural assessment of muscle injuries. The severity of a muscle injury determined by imaging findings has a decisive influence on therapy planning and affects prognosis. Imaging is of high importance when the diagnosis or grade of injury is unclear, when recovery is taking longer than expected, and when interventional or surgical management may be needed. This narrative review will discuss ultrasound and MRI for the assessment of sports-related muscle injuries in the context of soccer, including advanced imaging techniques, with the focus on the clinical relevance of imaging findings for the prediction of return to play.","[('muscle injuries', 'disease', 22, 37), ('soccer', 'sport', 198, 204), ('muscle injuries', 'disease', 414, 429), ('muscle injury', 'disease', 449, 462), ('muscle injuries', 'disease', 841, 856), ('soccer', 'sport', 875, 881)]"
38008754,Presurgical perspective and postsurgical evaluation of acromioclavicular joint instability.,"Acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocations are a common cause of pain in patients of any age. Athletes who participate in contact sports, such as hockey, football, rugby, and soccer, are particularly susceptible to such injuries. The ACJ has an important role in the function of the upper limb, and its complexity of movement makes it susceptible to acute injuries and chronic dysfunction with debilitating effects that must be treated appropriately and promptly to preserve function. Recently, ACJ has received increasing attention due to the development of new surgical techniques for the restoration of normal function and stability. There is some agreement about the treatment of ACJ dislocations, but controversy remains about the treatment of Rockwood grade III dislocations, and a new approach to these injuries is suggested by ISAKOS. Overall, the paper summarizes new concepts in the anatomy of the ACJ and reviews the utility of imaging methods in ACJ dislocations as well as their treatment and complications.","[('acromioclavicular joint (acj) dislocations', 'disease', 0, 42), ('hockey', 'sport', 146, 152), ('football', 'sport', 154, 162), ('rugby', 'sport', 164, 169), ('soccer', 'sport', 175, 181), ('chronic dysfunction', 'disease', 369, 388), ('acj dislocations', 'disease', 684, 700), ('rockwood grade iii dislocations', 'disease', 749, 780), ('acj dislocations', 'disease', 958, 974)]"
37314437,The psychological effects of sports disruptions in NCAA Division I and II athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed methods analysis.,"Improving mental health outcomes in college athletics requires better understanding of how student-athletes respond to stress-inducing events.Using a cross-sectional design, this study aimed to assess student-athletes' mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible participants (N.=489) included Division I and II student-athletes at least 18 years of age with plans to compete in the 2020-2021 sport season. Participants completed an online battery of psychological health surveys.Survey results suggested high psychological strain (APSQ: 20.58±8.08), mild symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7: 7.66±5.51) and depression (PHQ-9: 7.51±5.65), and burnout (ABQ: 2.37±0.96).A subset of student-athletes reported symptoms of psychological strain, depression, and anxiety warranting follow-up clinical evaluation and/or treatment according to scoring guidelines. Findings encourage psychological screening, particularly during sport-disrupting events, to better support athletes' mental health during high-stress conditions.","[('athletics', 'sport', 44, 53), ('covid-19 ', 'disease', 251, 260), ('anxiety', 'disease', 584, 591), ('depression', 'disease', 615, 625), ('burnout', 'disease', 650, 657), ('depression', 'disease', 747, 757), ('anxiety', 'disease', 763, 770)]"
37081074,"Comparison of the neuromuscular response to three different Turkish, semi-professional football training sessions typically used within the tactical periodization training model.","This study examined the neuromuscular responses to three typical football (soccer) training sessions and the reliability of peak speed (PS) measured during a submaximal running test (SRT) for identifying neuromuscular fatigue (NMF) status. Jump height (CMJ) and peak velocity (CMJ) were collected from a CMJ test, while peak speed (PS) was collected during an SRT before and after each training session. Large effect size (ES) decreases were observed in each variable post-training (ES; - 1.42 to - 2.32). Significant differences (> 0.001) were detected between each football session's external load variables. Coefficients of variations were small (< 10%) with moderate (CMJ; 0.53, PS; 0.44) and strong (CMJ; 0.72) intraclass correlation coefficients between pre-test measures. The demands of each football session aligned with the principles of tactical periodization and were sufficient to produce the fatigue necessary to elicit physiological adaptations. PS was also shown to be a viable measure of monitoring NMF status.","[('football', 'sport', 65, 73), ('soccer', 'sport', 75, 81), ('neuromuscular fatigue', 'disease', 204, 225), ('nmf', 'disease', 227, 230), ('football', 'sport', 567, 575), ('football', 'sport', 799, 807), ('nmf', 'disease', 1015, 1018)]"
37782398,Isolated distal grade III lateral collateral ligament injury: what is the real clinical impact in professional athletes?,"The isolated III grade lateral collateral ligament injuries are rare, and there is limited literature available on their management. We report 3 cases of professional soccer players with isolated distal lateral collateral ligament III grade injury, confirmed by MRI studies. After undergoing MRI examinations, all three players resumed competitive activity without resting and experienced no consequences regarding joint stability. We assessed the significance of the lateral collateral ligament in providing lateral stabilization to the knee joint in professional footballers with clinical tears of the lateral collateral ligament. The other structures of posterolateral area that remain intact contribute to joint stability, and the lateral collateral ligament's extra-articular position appears to expedite the ligament's healing process. Therefore, we propose a possible conservative treatment approach, mostly for professional athletes and adolescent patients, involving a rehabilitation plan without the need for surgery.","[('lateral collateral ligament injuries', 'disease', 23, 59), ('soccer', 'sport', 167, 173), ('distal lateral collateral ligament iii grade injury', 'disease', 196, 247), ('tears of the lateral collateral ligament', 'disease', 591, 631)]"
37142260,Lateral Compartment Syndrome From Inversion Injury.,"A 17-year-old male presented for the evaluation of right calf pain after an inversion ankle sprain sustained while playing soccer 24 hours prior. On exam, he exhibited swelling and tenderness to palpation over his right calf, mild first web space numbness, and compartment pressures <30 mmHg. Magnetic resonance imaging was significant for findings of lateral compartment syndrome (CS). Upon admission, his exam worsened, prompting an anterior and lateral compartment fasciotomy. Intraoperative findings were significant for lateral CS, with findings of avulsed, nonviable muscle with associated hematoma. Postoperatively the patient had mild foot drop, which improved with physical therapy. Lateral CS rarely develops from an inversion ankle sprain. This presentation of CS is unique due to its mechanism, delayed clinical presentation, and limited signs of CS. Providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for CS in patients with this injury complex and continued pain beyond 24 hours without signs of ligamentous injury.","[('calf pain', 'disease', 57, 66), ('inversion ankle sprain', 'disease', 76, 98), ('soccer', 'sport', 123, 129), ('lateral compartment syndrome', 'disease', 352, 380), ('cs', 'disease', 382, 384), ('cs', 'disease', 533, 535), ('hematoma', 'disease', 596, 604), ('cs', 'disease', 700, 702), ('inversion ankle sprain', 'disease', 727, 749), ('cs', 'disease', 772, 774), ('cs', 'disease', 859, 861), ('cs', 'disease', 919, 921), ('ligamentous injury', 'disease', 1011, 1029)]"
36729891,Bilateral Ischial Tuberosity Stress Fractures in an Adolescent Football Player: A Case Report.,"Pelvic stress fractures are rare, making up an estimated 1% to 7% of all stress fractures with the primary locations being the pubic rami, pubic symphysis, and sacrum. Two cases of stress fractures of the ischium have been previously described in the literature, with both occurring in the ischial body. In this case, a 17-year-old high school American football player presented with nonspecific pelvic pain and bilateral point tenderness on deep palpation of the ischial tuberosities. Advanced imaging identified bilateral ischial tuberosity stress fractures. This report outlines the diagnosis and management of the first reported case of bilateral ischial tuberosity stress fractures. We report how ischial tuberosity stress fractures present clinically, potential management strategies, and highlight the use of computed tomography imaging for pelvic stress fractures.

36845166,"Sudden Cardiac Arrest in Basketball and Soccer Stadiums, the Role of Automated External Defibrillators: A Review. For the BELTRAN Study (BaskEtbaLl and soccer sTadiums: Registry on Automatic exterNal defibrillators).","Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) during sports events has a dramatic impact on stadium-goers and the public and is often associated with poor outcomes unless treated with an automated external defibrillator (AED). Despite this, stadiums vary in AED use. This review aims to identify the risks and incidences of SCA, and the use of AEDs in soccer and basketball stadiums. A narrative review of all relevant papers was conducted. Athletes across all sports face an SCA risk of 1:50,000 athlete-years, with the greatest risk of SCA in young male athletes (1:35,000 person-years) and black male athletes (1:18,000 person-years). Africa and South America have the poorest soccer SCA outcomes at 3% and 4% survival. AED use on-site improves survival greater than defibrillation by emergency services. Many stadiums do not have AEDs implemented into medical plans and the AEDs are often unrecognisable or are obstructed. Therefore, AEDs should be used on-site, use clear signalling, have certified trained personnel, and be incorporated into stadiums' medical plans.","[('sudden cardiac arrest', 'disease', 0, 21), ('sca', 'disease', 23, 26), ('sca', 'disease', 306, 309), ('soccer', 'sport', 334, 340), ('basketball', 'sport', 345, 355), ('sca', 'disease', 458, 461), ('sca', 'disease', 520, 523), ('soccer', 'sport', 662, 668), ('sca', 'disease', 669, 672)]"
37435120,Considerations for Developing a Mental Health Emergency Action Plan for High School Football Programs and Athletic Departments.,"High school students in the United States are being educated during an unprecedented time of social unrest, public health concerns, and gun violence. High school student athletes can be further challenged by sports-related stressors that may lead to anxiety, burnout, depression, disordered eating, sleep difficulty, performance-based identity concerns, and substance use. High school football players, in particular, are at higher risk of concussion, musculoskeletal injury, and may feel excess pressure to compete from coaches, parents, and peers. One way to address these stressors among high school student athletes is to increase athletic department staff members' awareness of the symptoms of mental health disorders. Increased awareness helps staff members recognize when an athlete is in crisis, as well as respond with an established mental health emergency action plan as needed. In this review article, the authors provide a blueprint by which high school personnel can more readily identify and respond to mental health emergencies among student athletes.","[('anxiety', 'disease', 250, 257), ('burnout', 'disease', 259, 266), ('depression', 'disease', 268, 278), ('disordered eating', 'disease', 280, 297), ('football', 'sport', 385, 393), ('musculoskeletal injury', 'disease', 452, 474), ('mental health disorders', 'disease', 699, 722)]"
37755838,"Soccer and Disability, Is It Possible? Analysis of the Learning and Coaching Context in Spain.","Coaching a youth soccer player is important, and the coach's role is key. Actually, there is no profile or coaching program for grassroots-soccer coaches that favor the practice of soccer and disability, according to different research and experts. The main purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the professional profile of the grassroots-soccer coach who has soccer players with disabilities (learning and coaching context). This research applies a quantitative method, specifically, non-experimental, cross-sectional, descriptive, and inferential methodology. The sample of analysis is the staff members of the professional soccer clubs of LaLigaSantander Genuine (Spain). An important result is that half of the grassroots-soccer coaches have not received specific education to coach youth soccer players with disabilities. Finally, one important conclusion of this research is that by generating a climate of trust and empathy, grassroots-soccer coaches improve the performance of their soccer players with disabilities by recognizing and understanding their emotional states.","[('soccer', 'sport', 17, 23), ('soccer', 'sport', 139, 145), ('soccer', 'sport', 181, 187), ('soccer', 'sport', 350, 356), ('soccer', 'sport', 371, 377), ('soccer', 'sport', 637, 643), ('soccer', 'sport', 737, 743), ('soccer', 'sport', 804, 810), ('soccer', 'sport', 954, 960), ('soccer', 'sport', 1002, 1008)]"
37900877,Practicing Outside the Lines: Using Acupuncture in the Athletic Training Room and on the Field.,"Acupuncture can be used to treat athletes in an outpatient clinic setting, athletic training room, or even on a football field sideline. This article details 3 scenarios, in 3 illustrative cases, in which acupuncture was used for sports medicine in more unconventional settings. The author describes each case and shares his observations about them. First, acupuncture was used on a high-school football field sideline to help alleviate acute calf cramping in a player. Second, acupuncture was used in a division 2 college athletic training room to treat a player with subacute thoracic pain that was not improving with the usual treatments provided by the athletic trainers. Third, acupuncture was used to treat hamstring strain and tightness in a professional National Football League player to enhance his performance. These situations demonstrate the versatility of acupuncture in the realm of sports medicine. Acupuncture is an added-value service for athletes, and acupuncture providers should not be afraid to promote it in this population that is always looking for a competitive advantage.","[('football', 'sport', 112, 120), ('football', 'sport', 395, 403), ('calf cramping', 'disease', 443, 456), ('thoracic pain', 'disease', 578, 591), ('football', 'sport', 771, 779)]"
37340004,Leveraging football accelerometer data to quantify associations between repetitive head impacts and chronic traumatic encephalopathy in males.,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy associated with repetitive head impacts (RHI), but the components of RHI exposure underlying this relationship are unclear. We create a position exposure matrix (PEM), composed of American football helmet sensor data, summarized from literature review by player position and level of play. Using this PEM, we estimate measures of lifetime RHI exposure for a separate cohort of 631 football playing brain donors. Separate models examine the relationship between CTE pathology and players' concussion count, athletic positions, years of football, and PEM-derived measures, including estimated cumulative head impacts, linear accelerations, and rotational accelerations. Only duration of play and PEM-derived measures are significantly associated with CTE pathology. Models incorporating cumulative linear or rotational acceleration have better model fit and are better predictors of CTE pathology than duration of play or cumulative head impacts alone. These findings implicate cumulative head impact intensity in CTE pathogenesis.","[('chronic traumatic encephalopathy', 'disease', 0, 32), ('cte', 'disease', 34, 37), ('neurodegenerative tauopathy', 'disease', 44, 71), ('american football', 'sport', 252, 269), ('football', 'sport', 453, 461), ('cte pathology', 'disease', 533, 546), ('football', 'sport', 607, 615), ('cte pathology', 'disease', 821, 834), ('cte pathology', 'disease', 953, 966), ('cte', 'disease', 1084, 1087)]"

37358314,Backheel Pass During Forward Running as a Mechanism of Severe Acute Hamstring Injury in Football: A Case Report.,"Proximal hamstring tendon avulsions represent the most severe hamstring injury in sports and are typically sustained during stretch-related movements in closed kinetic chain: forced hip hyperflexion combined with knee extension. Here, we present the case study of the right-foot dominant professional football player with a severe proximal hamstring tendon avulsion injury and concomitant lower-grade injuries of hamstring muscle-tendon complex caused by a potentially new football-specific injury mechanism: right-foot backheel pass during forward running (ie, a kick directly backward). This mechanism involves a specific stretch-shortening cycle action of hamstring muscles in open-kinetic chain movement that has not yet been described in the scientific literature. Although further studies related to this football-specific hamstring injury mechanism are needed, clinicians and coaches working in football should be aware of it and potentially introduce additional injury mechanism-specific exercises and strategies for prevention of severe hamstring injuries which often require surgical intervention.","[('proximal hamstring tendon avulsions', 'disease', 0, 35), ('hamstring injury', 'disease', 62, 78), ('hip hyperflexion', 'disease', 182, 198), ('football', 'sport', 301, 309), ('proximal hamstring tendon avulsion injury', 'disease', 331, 372), ('injuries of hamstring muscle-tendon complex', 'disease', 401, 444), ('football', 'sport', 473, 481), ('football', 'sport', 811, 819), ('hamstring injury', 'disease', 829, 845), ('football', 'sport', 902, 910), ('hamstring injuries', 'disease', 1046, 1064)]"

This pilot intervention study examined the safety (ie, no vaso-occlusive episodes) of a 10-week organized sports program for children with SCD. Eight children with SCD (5 boys/3 girls), aged 7 to 12 years old, received 10 training sessions (each 90 min) once a week. Training sessions were performed by a professional soccer club under the supervision of a medical team from the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital. During the study period, one child experienced a vaso-occlusive crisis, which could not be directly related to the organized sports program. None of the other children experienced vaso-occlusive episodes. The results of this study indicate that children with SCD can participate safely in moderate-intensity organized sports activities when personalized medical background and practical training information is shared with the trainer beforehand.

The sample of the study consisted of 19 professional athletes (10 male; 9 female) competing in two different teams. The examined markers were body mass, BMI, fat percentage, speed, acceleration, explosiveness, vertical jumping ability, creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The preseason training period improved speed, acceleration, explosiveness and vertical jumping ability (~1-8%) and led to significant fat percentage reductions in both groups equivalently. CK and LDH increased similarly in both groups, and the percentage increases were higher for CK compared to LDH. Further investigation and a larger sample size are required in order to determine an approach that is more capable of maximizing performance without causing any possible injuries that may be related to muscle damage.","[('muscle damage', 'disease', 196, 209), ('basketball', 'sport', 291, 301), ('muscle damage', 'disease', 1104, 1117)]"
36814430,A Central Slip Injury in a Professional Basketball Player.,"Hand injuries are extremely prevalent in sports such as ball sports. Delayed diagnosis or improperly managed injuries have the potential to prolong the athlete's return to the competition and permanently damage their abilities. We report the case of a 35-year-old male professional basketball player who presented to a chiropractor with pain and swelling of the right fifth finger two days after a basketball game. The injury occurred when a player passed the basketball and the ball hit his fifth finger ""head-on"". Examination revealed enlargement of the middle joint of the right fifth finger and a boutonniere deformity. He was diagnosed with a central slip injury using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since there are no standard treatment guidelines for central slip injuries, multi-model chiropractic therapy was applied to the injury and adjacent sites. The patient returned to the game by the end of the third week and fully recovered within six weeks.

Through a database search of British-based news coverage of women's football, 100 news articles were identified in the first 6 months after the start of the pandemic. A thematic analysis was conducted, and five dominant frames were detected in the context of COVID-19: 1) ; 2) ; 3)  (e.g., alterations to national and international competitions); 4)  and 5)  (e.g., welfare, uncertain working conditions). These frames depart from the past trivialisation and sexualisation of women's sport, demonstrate the increased visibility of women's football, and shift the narrative towards the elite stratum of the game.

If left untreated, this can lead to ischemic contracture, which is a late sequelae of compartment syndrome that occurs when there is sustained ischemic damage to the muscles. Timely diagnosis and treatment are critical in reducing the extent of permanent changes within muscle and nerve tissue. No previously published studies have reported on the treatment of early ischemic contracture resulting from traumatic hematoma in the upper arm. We present an exceptional case involving a 17-year-old male who developed this condition following a collision during a basketball game, resulting in a hematoma with severe pain, tightness, and restricted range of motion in the affected arm.

37486253,Adductor longus and brevis lesion in an amateur soccer player: platelet rich plasma and multifractioned hyaluronic acid injections to enhance clinical recovery.,"Groin pain is a common issue in athletes, with a particularly high incidence in male soccer players. Adductor muscles are the most involved site of the groin, accounting for up to one-fourth of muscle injuries of that region. Physical therapy and rehabilitation programs for adductor-related groin pain using active exercises are effective in getting athletes back to sport. However, the return-to-play time varies according to the injury severity. Minor lesions can recover in 1-2 weeks, while severer injuries require 8-12 weeks. To enhance tendon healing and shorten the return to play time, intrandentinous injections of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) have been proposed.

36844000,Football training as a non-pharmacological treatment of the global aging population-A topical review.,"In the present topical mini-review, the beneficial impact of small-sided game football training for the increasing elderly global population is presented. As a multicomponent type of physical activity, football training executed on small pitched with 4-6 players in each team is targeting a myriad of physiological systems and causes positive adaptations of relevance for several non-communicable diseases, of which the incidence increases with advancing age. There is strong scientific evidence that this type of football training promotes cardiovascular, metabolic and musculo-skeletal health in elderly individuals. These positive adaptations can prevent cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, sarcopenia and osteoporosis, and lower the risk of falls. Also, football training has been proven an efficient part of the treatment of several patient groups including men with prostate cancer and women after breast cancer. Finally, regular football training has an anti-inflammatory effect and may slow the biological aging. Overall, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that recreational football training can promote health in the elderly.","[('football', 'sport', 78, 86), ('football', 'sport', 202, 210), ('football', 'sport', 514, 522), ('cardiovascular disease', 'disease', 658, 680), ('type 2 diabetes', 'disease', 682, 697), ('sarcopenia', 'disease', 699, 709), ('osteoporosis', 'disease', 714, 726), ('football', 'sport', 763, 771), ('prostate cancer', 'disease', 877, 892), ('breast cancer', 'disease', 909, 922), ('football', 'sport', 941, 949), ('football', 'sport', 1100, 1108)]"
37574608,In-depth mass spectrometry analysis of rhGH administration altered energy metabolism and steroidogenesis.,"Growth hormone, as a proteohormone, is primarily known of its dramatic effect on longitudinal growth. Recombinant DNA technology has provided a safe, abundant and comparatively cheap supply of human GH for growth hormone-deficient individuals. However, many healthy subjects, especially athletics, administrate GH for enhanced athletic performance or strength. A better and more comprehensive understanding of rhGH effect in healthy individuals is urgent and essential. In this study, we recruited 14 healthy young male and injected rhGH once. Untargeted LC-MS metabolomics profiling of serum and urine was performed before and after the rhGH injection. The GH-induced dysregulation of energy related pathways, such as amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, glycolysis and TCA cycle, was revealed. Moreover, individuals supplemented with micro-doses of rhGH exhibited significantly changed urinary steroidal profiles, suggesting a role of rhGH in both energy metabolism and steroidogenesis. We expect that our results will be helpful to provide new evidence on the effects of rhGH injection and provide potential biomarkers for rhGH administration.","[('growth hormone-deficient', 'disease', 206, 230), ('athletics', 'sport', 287, 296)]"

This case report describes the rare occurrence of joint autofusion following surgical fixation of an unstable mallet finger injury.We present a case of a 13-year-old right-hand dominant boy who sustained a right long finger bony mallet injury while playing football. Treatment consisted of closed reduction, percutaneous pinning of the right long finger distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. He went on to heal with residual DIP joint stiffness and only 20° of residual motion that were noted on the early follow-up. Seven years later, he presented with no motion at the right long finger DIP joint. X-rays of his right long finger showed a complete fusion of bone across the DIP joint.Autofusion as a complication of mallet finger surgery is an unprecedently rare finding, especially in the absence of any predisposing factors. This complication must be considered when treating mallet finger injuries through surgical intervention. Fortunately, the loss of DIP motion, complete in this case, had no long-term effect on the overall use of this patient's hand.","[('hand injury', 'disease', 26, 37), ('mallet finger injury', 'disease', 210, 230), ('right long finger bony mallet injury', 'disease', 306, 342), ('football', 'sport', 357, 365), ('mallet finger injuries', 'disease', 978, 1000)]"

IAE is most commonly associated with competitive athletics, particularly cycling, and remains a rather underappreciated diagnosis in the clinical setting. We present two unique and distinct presentations of IAE in competitive athletes. The first case involves a 38-year-old male cyclist who initially presented with complaints of a bulge at the right groin and acute onset monoplegia and paresthesia associated with exertion of the right lower extremity. This patient was referred to vascular surgery and underwent right common iliac artery and proximal common femoral artery endarterectomy with patch angioplasty and Fogarty embolectomy. Case 2 involves a 50-year-old female triathlete who presented with left lower extremity claudication of a more chronic course, with symptoms beginning approximately four years prior. The pain radiated to her upper thigh and was associated with exertion, restricting her exercise tolerance and return to training.

37739576,Long-term risk of cardiovascular disease after traumatic brain injury: screening and prevention.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly prevalent among individuals participating in contact sports, military personnel, and in the general population. Although it is well known that brain injury can cause neurological and psychiatric complications, evidence from studies on individuals exposed to a single or repetitive brain injuries suggests an understudied association between TBI and the risk of developing chronic cardiovascular diseases and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Several studies have shown that people without pre-existing comorbidities who sustain a TBI have a significantly higher risk of developing chronic cardiovascular disease, than people without TBI. Similar observations made in military and professional American-style football cohorts suggest causal pathways through which modifiable cardiovascular risk factors might mediate the relationship between brain injury and chronic neurological diseases. A better understanding of cardiovascular disease risk after TBI combined with a proactive, targeted screening programme might mitigate long-term morbidity and mortality in individuals with TBI, and improve their quality of life.","[('traumatic brain injury', 'disease', 0, 22), ('tbi', 'disease', 24, 27), ('brain injury', 'disease', 182, 194), ('neurological and psychiatric complications', 'disease', 205, 247), ('brain injuries', 'disease', 320, 334), ('tbi', 'disease', 380, 383), ('chronic cardiovascular diseases', 'disease', 411, 442), ('cardiovascular disease', 'disease', 464, 486), ('tbi', 'disease', 576, 579), ('chronic cardiovascular disease', 'disease', 627, 657), ('tbi', 'disease', 679, 682), ('american-style football', 'sport', 739, 762), ('cardiovascular risk', 'disease', 820, 839), ('brain injury', 'disease', 887, 899), ('chronic neurological diseases', 'disease', 904, 933), ('cardiovascular disease', 'disease', 961, 983), ('tbi', 'disease', 995, 998), ('tbi', 'disease', 1124, 1127)]"

The distal biceps tendon is an important supinator of the forearm and flexor of the elbow, thus an injury to this ligament can be invalidating for athletes. The aim of this review was to determine the ability and the time to return to sports following distal biceps tendon repair in athletes and the level of performance. The literature is scarce about the return to sports among athletes. Most studies include athletes are National Football League (NFL) players, others are weightlifters and a few recreational athletes. The return to play rate after distal biceps tendon repair is high. The performances of the returned players were similar to matched players and most players returned to the same level. Most players-depending on the sport-were not able to return to competition within the same season. In order to manage expectations, it should be discussed preoperatively with the athlete (and their coach) that the return to sports rate is high, but the return will probably be the following season.","[('distal biceps tendon ruptures', 'disease', 0, 29), ('weightlifting', 'sport', 127, 140), ('football', 'sport', 594, 602)]"

In the prevention group, the players had to perform specific exercises at the beginning of each training session twice a week.Injuries were recorded monthly in both groups with an online questionnaire.A significant decrease in the total number of injuries as well as in the severity of the injuries was observed in the prevention group in comparison to the control group (p = 0.0001-0.013). For the shoulder, a decrease in injury incidence was also observed in the prevention group. This decrease reached significance in male players (p = 0.045).The program appears to be efficient to reduce the risk of shoulder injuries in recreational volleyball players.

The sample consisted of 28 soccer players in the U-13 and 16 in the U-15 categories. Creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and DOMS were evaluated up to 72 h after the match. Muscle damage was elevated at 0 h in U-13, and from 0 h to 24 h in U-15. DOMS increased from 0 h to 72 h in U-13 and from 0 h to 48 h in U-15. Significant associations of SA and fat-free mass (FFM) with muscle damage markers and DOMS were observed only in U-13, specifically at time 0 h, when SA explained 56% of CK and 48% of DOMS and FFM explained 48% of DOMS. We concluded that in the U-13 category, higher SA is significantly associated with muscle damage markers, and increase in FFM is associated with muscle damage markers and DOMS. Furthermore, U-13 players need 24 h to recover pre-match muscle damage markers and more than 72 h to recover DOMS.

To address this, we opted for a full-thickness reconstruction using a graft under the Clearant Process of the Achilles tendon. As an innovative approach, we proposed an alternative fixation technique, employing a Bio Composite Arthrex 9 mm x 35 mm interference screw, placed at the apex of the calcaneus body. For a period of 5 years, the patient underwent regular imaging follow-ups with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical assessments using the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Activity Subscale Score and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Sports Subscale Score. This case highlights the importance of exploring novel fixation methods for Achilles tendon reconstruction, particularly in cases of rerupture.

For this, 36 preadolescent female soccer players (10-12 years old) were randomly allocated to the FIFA 11+ Kids program and control groups (18 players per group). The intervention group performed the FIFA 11+ Kids warm-up program twice per week for 8 weeks, while the control group continued with regular warm-up. Trunk, hip, and knee peak angles (from initial ground contact to peak knee flexion) were collected during the single-leg drop landing using a 3D motion capture system. A repeated measure ANOVA was used to analyze groups over time. Significant group × time interactions were found for the peak knee flexion, with a medium effect size ( = 0.05; effect size = 0.11), and peak hip internal rotation angles, with a large effect size ( < 0.01; effect size = 0.28).

Overall, injury patterns in volleyball in the past decade showed similar distribution to prior studies, but the rate of injury may be decreasing. Common injuries in volleyball include ankle sprains, patellar tendinopathy, finger and thumb sprains, overuse injuries of the shoulder, and concussions. Injury surveillance from the NCAA has demonstrated injury trends at the collegiate level, but further longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate injury at the professional level and for beach volleyball to help develop injury prevention strategy.","[('volleyball', 'sport', 78, 88), ('volleyball', 'sport', 201, 211), ('volleyball', 'sport', 632, 642), ('volleyball', 'sport', 692, 702), ('volleyball', 'sport', 829, 839), ('injuries of the shoulder', 'disease', 920, 944), ('beach volleyball', 'sport', 1150, 1166)]"
37736666,Effects of shoe collar types on ankle and knee biomechanics characteristics when performing the side-step cutting task.,"This study aimed to examine the effect of football shoes with different collar types on ankle and knee kinematic and kinetics features during 45° and 135° side-step cutting tasks. Fifteen healthy college football players volunteered for the study. Each participant was instructed to perform side-step cutting tasks with high, low, and no collar football shoes. The kinematic and ground reaction force data were measured using a Vicon motion capture system and a Kistler force plate, respectively. Two-way MANOVAs with repeated measures were used to examine the effect of shoe collar type and task conditions. There were no interaction effects. The high collar football shoe showed decreased ankle range of motion in the sagittal plane ( = 0.010) and peak ankle external rotation moment ( = 0.009) compared to the no collar football shoe. The high ( = 0.025) and low ( = 0.029) collar football shoes presented greater peak ankle external rotation angles than the no collar football shoe. These results imply that football shoes with high collars made of high intensity knitted fabric could be used to restrict ankle joint movement, with potential implications for decreasing the risk of ankle sprain injuries in football players.","[('football', 'sport', 42, 50), ('football', 'sport', 204, 212), ('football', 'sport', 345, 353), ('football', 'sport', 660, 668), ('football', 'sport', 823, 831), ('football', 'sport', 884, 892), ('football', 'sport', 972, 980), ('football', 'sport', 1012, 1020), ('ankle sprain injuries', 'disease', 1186, 1207), ('football', 'sport', 1211, 1219)]"
38021974,How Subtalar Kinematics Affects Knee Laxity in Soccer Players After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury?,"Purpose The goal of the current study was to ascertain whether there is an association between foot pronation and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in a group of elite professional soccer players. Methods Two groups of soccer players were studied, all of whom played in the Greek Super League. The ACL group included players who had suffered an ACL injury in the last 2 years. The non-ACL group was composed of players who had never suffered an ACL injury. We used a 3D baropodometric laser scanner to measure pronation or overpronation (navicular drop phenomenon) of the subtalar joint and how this affects the subtalar joint while standing. We assessed ACL laxity using the Genourob Rotab. Results ACL-injured patients, regardless of the mechanism of injury, exhibited greater navicular drop values than a randomly selected group of subjects with no history of ACL injury. Conclusion Greater knee joint laxity and subtalar pronation may be associated with an increased risk of ACL injury. Pronation of the foot appears to be a risk factor for ACL injury. These findings should be integrated into future studies to better define how neuromuscular control related to lower extremity biomechanics is associated with ACL injury.","[('anterior cruciate ligament (acl) injury', 'disease', 114, 153), ('soccer', 'sport', 187, 193), ('acl injury', 'disease', 351, 361), ('acl injury', 'disease', 451, 461), ('acl-injured patients', 'disease', 706, 726), ('injury', 'disease', 759, 765), ('acl injury', 'disease', 869, 879), ('acl injury', 'disease', 985, 995), ('acl injury', 'disease', 1051, 1061), ('acl injury', 'disease', 1221, 1231)]"
37662228,Heterogeneous SARS-CoV-2 kinetics due to variable timing and intensity of immune responses.,"The viral kinetics of documented SARS-CoV-2 infections exhibit a high degree of inter-individual variability. We identified six distinct viral shedding patterns, which differed according to peak viral load, duration, expansion rate and clearance rate, by clustering data from 810 infections in the National Basketball Association cohort. Omicron variant infections in previously vaccinated individuals generally led to lower cumulative shedding levels of SARS-CoV-2 than other scenarios. We then developed a mechanistic mathematical model that recapitulated 1510 observed viral trajectories, including viral rebound and cases of reinfection. Lower peak viral loads were explained by a more rapid and sustained transition of susceptible cells to a refractory state during infection, as well as an earlier and more potent late, cytolytic immune response. Our results suggest that viral elimination occurs more rapidly during omicron infection, following vaccination, and following re-infection due to enhanced innate and acquired immune responses. Because viral load has been linked with COVID-19 severity and transmission risk, our model provides a framework for understanding the wide range of observed SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes.","[('sars-cov-2 infections', 'disease', 33, 54), ('basketball', 'sport', 307, 317), ('omicron infection', 'disease', 923, 940), ('covid-19', 'disease', 1086, 1094), ('sars-cov-2 infection', 'disease', 1203, 1223)]"
37791208,Multiple Bony Mallet Finger Injuries in One Hand of a 14-Year-Old Boy.,"Bony mallet finger injuries, commonly seen as isolated incidents, typically occur in active individuals. We report a rare case of simultaneous avulsion fractures at the distal phalangeal bases of the second, third, and fourth fingers on the right hand of a 14-year-old boy following a forced passive flexion injury during a football game. The patient initially received conservative management with a finger extension splint for the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. However, one week after the injury, we performed surgical fixation on all affected digits using the K-wire extension block method due to multiple fractures and the patient's intolerance for the mallet finger splint. After six weeks, all K-wires were removed, and physiotherapy sessions began. Three months post-injury, the second and fourth DIP joints demonstrated an ""Excellent"" outcome, and the third DIP joint demonstrated a ""Good"" outcome based on Crawford's criteria for outcome assessment of mallet finger injury after management. This case highlights the importance of early detection and appropriate management of concomitant mallet finger injuries in pediatric patients to prevent potential complications that could impair hand function and quality of life.","[('bony mallet finger injuries', 'disease', 0, 27), ('avulsion fractures', 'disease', 143, 161), ('forced passive flexion injury', 'disease', 285, 314), ('football', 'sport', 324, 332), ('mallet finger injury', 'disease', 968, 988), ('mallet finger injuries', 'disease', 1104, 1126)]"
37055780,Compensatory muscle activation and spinal curve changes in response to fatigue among adolescent male athletes.,"The prone plank test has been often used to assess the strength and endurance of trunk muscles. We aimed to develop a new measurement protocol to objectively monitor the changes in spinal curves and muscle activity simultaneously.Eleven adolescent male basketball athletes (13-17 years) performed a one-minute plank test. Spinal curvatures (thoracic kyphosis (TK) and lumbar lordosis (LL)) were determined at each time point by optical tracking of markers placed on the spinous processes of 10 vertebrae. Eleven muscles were measured by surface electromyography to determine muscle fatigue via changes in median frequency.TK significantly increased (p = 0.003) from the first to the last 10 s of the plank test; changes in LL were mixed within the group. Only the rectus abdominis showed consistent and significant fatigue (p < 0.001). The increased spinal curves significantly correlated with the fatigue of biceps femoris (TK: r = -0.75, p = 0.012; LL: r = -0.71, p = 0.019) indicating a compensatory muscle activation and spinal curve changes in response to fatigue.Our protocol may support future researches that aim to objectively evaluate the prone plank test and which posture-related muscles need strengthening for the individual.","[('basketball', 'sport', 253, 263), ('thoracic kyphosis', 'disease', 341, 358), ('lumbar lordosis', 'disease', 368, 383), ('fatigue of biceps femoris', 'disease', 898, 923)]"
37374163,Athletic Burnout and Its Association with Diet in Children and Adolescents.,"Children today are constantly exposed to several risk factors and high levels of stress that can impact their mental, emotional, and physical health, which can trigger burnout. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and frequency of burnout in young amateur athletes and to study the role of the Mediterranean diet on burnout risk. An observational, cross-sectional, and descriptive study of 183 basketball players between 8 and 15 years old was carried out. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the KIDMED questionnaire and the risk of burnout was assessed with the Athlete Burnout Questionnaire. Medians, minimums and maximum values for quantitative variables and absolute frequencies and percentages for qualitative variables were obtained. The results show a higher percentage of burnout among girls. The children who meet the established threshold for burnout spend more time watching television. Participants with better adherence to the Mediterranean diet have lower burnout values in both genders and those with a higher risk of burnout have a worse adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Therefore, it is important to implement a balanced diet appropriate to the individual needs of the athlete.","[('burnout', 'disease', 168, 175), ('burnout', 'disease', 254, 261), ('burnout risk', 'disease', 339, 351), ('basketball', 'sport', 417, 427), ('burnout', 'disease', 576, 583), ('burnout', 'disease', 823, 830), ('burnout', 'disease', 896, 903), ('burnout', 'disease', 1013, 1020), ('burnout', 'disease', 1076, 1083)]"
37706096,Raw Water and ALS: A Unifying Hypothesis for the Environmental Agents Involved in ALS.,"Different studies identified the presence of several altered genes in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) forms. The experimental data, together with the epidemiological data, would seem to suggest the existence of molecular mechanisms (e.g., axonal transport) related to these genes, together with a susceptibility of the same genes to certain environmental factors that would therefore suggest an impact of the environment on the etiopathogenesis of ALS. In our review, we considered the most relevant environmental clusters around the world, collecting different hypotheses and underlining common environmental factors among the different clusters. Moreover, further epidemiological data identified a higher risk of ALS in professional athletes and, in particular, in soccer and football players. Despite this increased risk of ALS highlighted by the epidemiological evidence in aforementioned sports, the mechanisms remain unclear. At last, the use of raw water has been associated with ALS risk. The aim of the present review is to characterize a possible relationship between these clusters, to be explored in the context of the interaction between genetic and environmental factors on the etiopathogenesis of ALS.","[('amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'disease', 92, 121), ('als', 'disease', 123, 126), ('als', 'disease', 474, 477), ('als', 'disease', 741, 744), ('football', 'sport', 804, 812), ('als', 'disease', 853, 856), ('als', 'disease', 1013, 1016), ('als', 'disease', 1238, 1241)]"
37662530,"Wheelchair basketball, health, competitive analysis, and performance advantage: a review of theory and evidence.","The purpose of this study was to review the various risks and benefits of wheelchair basketball (WB) and explore some of the research which outlines factors that influence WB player performance and conditioning. WB offers several physical and psychological advantages. Physically, it can improve muscle strength, endurance, and cardiovascular fitness while decreasing the prevalence of chronic physical disorders. From a psychological standpoint, WB has been shown to alleviate anxiety and feelings of depression while also creating and improving social relationships. Despite the many benefits, WB can cause injuries, particularly in the upper extremities, and preventative measures should be employed. WB necessitates intense intermittent efforts and athletes must maintain excellent cardiovascular fitness, strength, and muscular endurance. Healthy sleeping patterns have also been shown to improve performance in WB players. Wheelchair mobility and biomechanical variables as well as wheelchair size and weight appear to be critical success elements in WB. WB can be a powerful tool for coaches and therapists to boost the physical and emotional health of individuals with disabilities and motivate them to participate in team-based sport.","[('wheelchair basketball', 'sport', 74, 95), ('wb', 'sport', 97, 99), ('wb', 'sport', 172, 174), ('wb', 'sport', 212, 214), ('chronic physical disorders', 'disease', 386, 412), ('wb', 'sport', 447, 449), ('anxiety', 'disease', 478, 485), ('depression', 'disease', 502, 512), ('wb', 'sport', 596, 598), ('wb', 'sport', 704, 706), ('wb', 'sport', 917, 919), ('wb', 'sport', 1057, 1059), ('wb', 'sport', 1061, 1063)]"

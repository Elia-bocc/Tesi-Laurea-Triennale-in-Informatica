37463234,Relative Age Effects and Self-Organized Sport Practices Among Adults.,"Given that previous research on relative age effects (RAEs) has only focused on organized sport, the aim of this exploratory study was to examine whether this phenomenon also existed among self-organized practitioners. In relation to that, a second aim was to know whether self-organized sport practices could be favored by late-born practitioners as a result of a strategic adaptation.  Representative sub-samples of 474 soccer players, 363 basketball players, 2,536 swimmers, 1,788 strength training practitioners, 1,873 pétanque players, 973 table tennis players and 2,136 runners were analyzed.  The results did not show any significant RAEs, including in sport practices that are sensitive to this phenomenon such as soccer or basketball. The results did not show any significant overrepresentation of late-born people either.  This study suggests that self-organized sport practices are not impacted by the RAEs. This finding is interesting because self-organized sport practice is the most important one in numbers.","[('soccer', 'sport', 422, 428), ('basketball', 'sport', 442, 452), ('strength training', 'sport', 484, 501), ('pétanque', 'sport', 523, 531), ('table tennis', 'sport', 545, 557), ('soccer', 'sport', 722, 728), ('basketball', 'sport', 732, 742)]"
37600398,Stakeholder governance and sustainability in football: A bibliometric analysis.,"This study presents a bibliometric analysis of stakeholder governance and sustainability in football. The PRISMA statement and the main techniques from the existing bibliometric analysis toolbox are applied to guide the research. The analysis includes 127 documents from Scopus and WoS, covering the period from 2007 to mid-2023, to examine the performance analysis and science mapping of the subject over time. The study's key findings highlight publication-related metrics, citation-and-publication-related metrics, co-authorship analysis, and co-word analysis. The analysis also identifies research gaps, including the need to explore barriers to stakeholder governance in football, the application of stakeholder pressure frameworks in football clubs, the examination of mimetic and normative pressures in the context of sustainability and governance in football, and the involvement of stakeholders and football institutions in collaborative efforts to enhance the effectiveness and impact of sustainability initiatives.","[('football', 'sport', 92, 100), ('football', 'sport', 676, 684), ('football', 'sport', 740, 748), ('football', 'sport', 858, 866), ('football', 'sport', 908, 916)]"
37436362,"Beyond Suppressing Testosterone: A Categorical System to Achieve a ""Level Playing Field"" in Sport.","Regulations implemented by World Athletics (WA) require female athletes with differences of sexual development to suppress their blood testosterone levels in order to participate in certain women's sporting competitions. These regulations have been justified by reference to fairness. In this paper, we reconstruct WA's understanding of fairness, which requires a ""level playing field"" where no athlete should have a significant performance advantage based on factors other than talent, dedication, and hard work over an average athlete in their category. We demonstrate that by placing regulations only on testosterone levels, while ignoring physical as well as socioeconomic advantages, WA consistently fails to meet its own definition of fairness. We then discuss several ways in which this definition could be met. Our analysis shows that a categorical system, in which athletes are divided into categories based on properties leading to significant performance advantages, is best suited for meeting WA's definition of fairness.","[('athletics', 'sport', 33, 42)]"
37171664,Gambling-like Features in fan Tokens.,"Fan tokens are a form of cryptocurrency that allow owners to participate in various fan-related experiences such as voting on the music to be played during half-time breaks in sporting events. Since 2020, many elite sport teams have issued fan tokens, allegedly as a way to engage with fans and hear their voice. However, fan tokens also raise some concerns. They are largely gamified digital items that intend to keep fans within the providers' app. Also, they can be traded in exchange platforms, which arguably transform them into collectibles, whose value can vary over time. Here, we explore fan tokens through a case study from a football (soccer) club (i.e., an F.C. Barcelona fan token). Drawing on literature from situational and structural characteristics of gambling, we analyse the gambling-like features that fan tokens include in their product design. Such features are discussed from a public health perspective, comparing what they mean in gambling contexts and how potentially harmful they could be for fan token holders.","[('football', 'sport', 636, 644), ('soccer', 'sport', 646, 652)]"
37552715,Repeated stroboscopic vision training improves anticipation skill without changing perceptual-cognitive skills in soccer players.,"In this study we aimed to analyze the repeated effect of stroboscopic vision training on perceptual-cognitive skills in soccer players. A total of 28 male soccer players participated in this experimental and randomized study with parallel groups. The soccer players were pair-matched according to perceptual-cognitive skills and randomized into two groups: Stroboscopic vision training and Control. Multiple object tracking, anticipation, and decision-making skills were measured before and after the 8-week intervention. An increase in multiple object tracking ( < 0.05) and decision-making skills ( < 0.05) from baseline to post-experiment was found in both groups without main group effect ( > 0.05). The findings showed an increase in anticipation skill from baseline to post-experiment in both groups ( < 0.05), with higher anticipation skill for the stroboscopic group than in the control group post-experiment ( < 0.05). Thus, we conclude that repeated stroboscopic vision training could improve anticipation skill in soccer athletes.","[('soccer', 'sport', 120, 126), ('soccer', 'sport', 155, 161), ('soccer', 'sport', 251, 257), ('soccer', 'sport', 1025, 1031)]"

Omega-3 fatty acids are neuroprotective against head impacts. A biomarker of omega-3 tissue status, red blood cell (RBC) omega-3 content is reduced during soccer activity. However, whether these changes are associated with frequent heading impacts is unknown.  Explore the association between soccer heading frequencies and RBC omega-3 status.  A prospective cohort study in collegiate women soccer players (  =  16). Players' RBC omega-3 status, Omega-3 Index, and self-reported gameplay header frequencies collected during a competitive season.  Mean Omega-3 Index (i.e., pre/postseason) was low (3.95  ±  0.44%). Postseason Omega-3 Index negatively correlated (  =  -0.545,   =  0.029) with heading frequencies. Change in Omega-3 Index negatively correlated (  =  -0.663,   =  0.005) with average headers per game.

37665863,No relevant spectator impact on home advantage in male and female professional volleyball - A longitudinal multilevel logistic model analysis over 25 years.,"Home advantage (HA) regularly occurs in volleyball (Pollard et al., 2017: men: 56.62%, women: 55.26%). Research to date has investigated primarily small samples of mostly female matches and not looked into the potential impact of spectators on HA. This archival analysis uses multilevel modelling to examine HA in professional German volleyball (men & women) over 25 seasons in all regular and play-off matches (N = 6,833). We analyze how spectators drive HA and whether this projects to the COVID-19 season 2020/21. When intercepts varied between teams (2-level model, ICC = 27%), the winning probability increased when playing at home (men: 57.01%, OR = 2.39, d = 0.48; women: 55.39%, OR = 2.19, d = 0.43), while controlling for team strength, interaction with gender, and travelling distance. More spectators had a negligible effect on the men's and women's chances (|d| < 0.07). Similar trends were observed for the probability of winning sets. Contrary to other team sports (e.g., soccer), there is no HA-development over the last decades.","[('). researc', 'sport', 100, 110), ('on ha. thi', 'sport', 241, 251), ('soccer', 'sport', 986, 992)]"

The sample consisted of 22 matches and 2,743 offensive actions, resulting in 8 sub-networks with 368 nodes and 6221 edges. The results showed from macro view the variables that presented highest centrality values were Attack Zone 4 (range 0.56-0.90), Attack Tempo 2 (0.65-0.87), Power Attack (0.62-0.94), No Touch Block (0.61-1), Attack Effect Continuity (0.59-0.94), and Middle Blocker Centralized (0.60-0.95). In a micro view, Reception Effect, Play Position, Reception Zone, and Block Composition showed high variability in each sub-network. The intra- and inter-team variability presented the importance of to respect each team idiosyncrasies and to consider the different approaches to the game and success.","[('volleyball', 'sport', 100, 110), ('volleyball', 'sport', 241, 251)]"
37983926,An unexpected shift in constant year effects in female elite handball.,"One of the most convincing studies about the importance of the cutoff date in relative age effects was when Helsen et al. (2000) showed that a shift in the date directly resulted in a change of birth month distributions in soccer. Over the past four decades, the role of the birth year has also been associated with relative age effects (as reflected in constant year effects). In this investigation, two studies attempted to replicate the shift of birth year distributions caused by a change in birth years in international female handball. In Study 1, the results from the female handball world championship 2017 showed a significant within-year effect overall and a constant year effect for players born 1988 and after. A second study was conducted with female players from world championships in 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015. Results demonstrated small effect sizes for most tests. However, there was an unexpected trend toward a constant year effect shift at the age of 28 years. Several hypotheses are presented as an explanation for this trend.","[('soccer', 'sport', 223, 229), ('handball', 'sport', 532, 540)]"

By employing a qualitative content analysis of media reports, scientific literature, and annual reports from 2000 to 2021, the research scrutinizes the varying approaches and investments of these tech giants in the domain of sports. The findings classify these companies into three distinct categories: (1) those actively securing broadcast rights for major competitions and leagues (Google, Facebook, Amazon); (2) those primarily producing and disseminating soccer documentaries (Netflix); and (3) those not directly engaging in media rights but advancing the technological aspects of clubs and leagues (Apple and Microsoft). This study underscores the escalating significance of Big Tech in reshaping the sports media landscape and calls for further research to comprehend the broader implications of their presence in sports broadcasting and fan engagement.","[('soccer', 'sport', 188, 194), ('soccer', 'sport', 655, 661)]"
37304573,Irrational Beliefs Among Competitive High School Student Athletes: Are they General or Context-Driven?,"While student-athletes strive for high performance both athletically and academically, understanding the role of beliefs as it relates to objective measures of performance has not been readily studied (Turner and Barker in J Appl Sport Psychol 25:131-147, 2013) and even less so among youth. This research examined if irrational beliefs that are context specific to performance settings (academic vs. athletic) are more predictive of academic and athletic performance than those more general irrational beliefs among 30 high-school student athlete basketball players. While both general and context-specific irrational beliefs were predictive of athletic performance as measured by performance analysis from game video footage and academic performance as measured by Grade Point Average, there were no differences in terms of their predictive ability. Implications for researchers and practitioners are provided to guide the scholarly research and applied implications regarding the role of specific beliefs as it relates to performance with this population.","[('basketball', 'sport', 548, 558)]"

37511949,Pilot Study: The Relationship between Foot Posture and Movement Quality in Non-Professional Male Football Players.,"(1) Background: This study focusses on establishing the relationship between quality of movement (based on the functional movement screen, or FMS) and foot posture (based on the foot posture index, or FPI-6). We hypothesised that a poor FMS test score may be derived from the foot position in the space measured by FPI-6. (2) Methods: a quasi-experimental and cross-sectional study was designed to analyse foot posture in 30 healthy football players, using the foot posture index and the functional movement screen. (3) Results: No significant relationships were found between movement quality and foot posture. Poor movement quality is present in more than half of all foot positions, supination, pronation, and neutral. Good quality seems to be more associated with a neutral foot position (23.3%) and supinated (16.6%) than a pronated foot position (6.6%). (4) Conclusions: this study found no relationship between the two tests; therefore, we cannot demonstrate that foot posture is relevant in the quality of the movement of the football players studied.","[('football', 'sport', 433, 441), ('football', 'sport', 1034, 1042)]"
36836815,Reliability of a Custom Device Used to Measure Isometric Knee Flexor and Extensor Strength in Standing Position.,"Assessing lower limb strength in the field is problematic, as the ""gold standard assessment"" with isokinetic strength is cumbersome, and the device is costly and not transportable and keeps the angle of the hip at around 90°. : We evaluated isometric muscle strength in a standing position with the help of an exoskeleton that holds the subject and makes the test easily repeatable.  The optimal device angles for hip and knee were, respectively, 20° and 80° for flexor tests and 30° and 40° for extensor tests. Test-retest reliability was very high for the right knee extensor (ICC 0.96-0.98), left knee extensor (ICC 0.96-0.97), right knee flexor (ICC 0.91-0.96), and left knee flexor (ICC 0.96-0.97). Furthermore, the typical error in percent (T.E.%) ranged from 2.50 to 5.50%, and the change in the mean in percent ranged from 0.84 to 7.72%, making it possible to determine even a slight variation in force.  this new method could represent a valid alternative for assessing strength, due to the high reliability and the favorable joint position, particularly in football.","[('football', 'sport', 1067, 1075)]"
36670707,How Football Players' Age Affect Passing Patterns of Play According to Field Location.,"This study aimed to characterize the passing patterns that support collective tactical behaviour in football players of different ages (U15, U17, and U19) in different field zones. Two hundred and twenty-eight male players, divided into U15, U17, and U19, participated in the study. Cluster analysis was used to group the passes into three sizes (short, medium, and long). The chi-square test was used to analyse the effect of player age on game-passing patterns in each field zone. The results revealed that long and medium passes were used more in areas close to the goals and short passes in the middle area of the field, concerning all ages (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the analysis of the relative distance between the ball carrier and the receiver indicated that older players (U17 and U19) used more distant players to pass the ball in medium and long passes. These results can help coaches design small-sided games according to the players’ ages and adjust to the field’s space and the numerical relationship, thus creating a greater transfer from training to competition.","[('football', 'sport', 100, 108)]"
37923817,Measuring skill via player dynamics in football dribbling.,"Although a myriad of studies have been conducted on player behavior in football, in-depth studies with structured theory are rare due to the difficulty in quantifying individual player skills and team strategies. We propose a physics-based mathematical model that describes football players' movements during dribbling situations, parameterized by the attacker aggressiveness, the defender hesitance and the top speed of both players. These player- and situation-specific parameters are extracted by fitting the model to real player trajectories from Major League Soccer games, and enable the quantification of player dribbling attributes and decisions beyond classical statistics. We show that the model captures the essential dribbling dynamics, and analyze how differences between parameters in varying game situations provide valuable insights into players' behavior. Lastly, we quantitatively study how changes in the player's parameters impact dribbling performance, enabling the model to provide scientific guidance to player training, scouting and game strategy development.","[('football', 'sport', 71, 79), ('football', 'sport', 274, 282), ('soccer', 'sport', 564, 570)]"

We conducted two main analyses: (a) An examination of RAE for all registered players in the Japan Women's Soccer League (Nadeshiko League) from 2016 to 2020; and (b) an examination of RAE of newly registered players in the league from 2017 to 2020. In the first analysis, we found a significant difference between the number of players born in Q1 (April-June) versus Q4 (January-March), with the number of players born in Q1 greater and with the ratio between these groups ranging from 1.5 to 1.7. In the second analysis, we found a significant relationship between Q1 and Q4 for the 2017 season alone. However, the Q1/Q4 ratio ranged from 1.4 to 1.9, and the semester ratio of S1 (Q1 + Q2))/S2 (Q3 + Q4) ranged from 1.2 to 1.3, suggesting a birth month bias. Thus, there was a RAE in female soccer players playing recently in Japan's top-level leagues; and the size of the effect did not change significantly across recent seasons.","[('soccer', 'sport', 88, 94), ('soccer', 'sport', 261, 267), ('soccer', 'sport', 947, 953)]"

Six hundred and twelve athletes ≤18 years old completed an online survey on sunscreen education and use during competitions and practices. Regardless of sport, reported sunscreen use was higher during practices than competition ( < 0.0001). Sunscreen was used most by swimmers/divers (odds ratio: OR ≥ 1.9,  < 0.001) and least by American football players (OR ≤ 0.57,  ≤ 0.001).

36997561,A novel characterisation protocol of mechanical interactions between the ground and a tibial prosthesis for long jump.,"The mechanical study of Running Specific Prostheses (RSPs) is often limited to the blade. The setup developed and presented herein is a simple experiment, based on a mechanical testing machine and a camera, that assesses two indicators relevant to coaches and athletes in the field of athletics: secant stiffness and energy dissipation. The influence of four parameters on global prosthesis behaviour is evaluated: the load line offset, the prosthesis-ground angle, the sole type and the flooring type. The load line offset and the flooring type have little to no influence on their behaviour. The prosthesis-ground angle impacts the stiffness: an increase in the angle brings a significant decrease in stiffness, which strongly impacts the performance. The type of sole modifies the kinematics of the blade tip's interaction with the ground. However, this effect is less likely to enhance the sports practice since athletics imposes the use of spikes. The camera images allow assessing the local behaviour of the sole, thus enabling to follow its strain through the compression process.","[('running', 'sport', 24, 31), ('athletics', 'sport', 285, 294), ('athletics', 'sport', 916, 925)]"
37708203,Optionality in Australian Football League draftee contracts.,"Though player drafts have commonly been utilised to equitably disperse amateur talent and avoid bidding wars, often they have also been accused of creating a monopsony labour market which restricts player movement. Within the Australian Football League (AFL) some have called for the increase of the initial draftee contract from two to three seasons, which further pushes the envelope on monopsony power. Instead of increasing the contract length, this paper suggests a call option to be purchased by the teams allowing them to add a further season to the draftee contract at a predetermined compensation package should they choose to do so at the end of the initial contract. The call prices per pick were calculated using the Black-Scholes model and were valued between 1% and 1.5% of the pick value. However, it failed to follow a monotonic function similar to pick value, owing to managerial overconfidence and sunk investment plays. Overall, the findings allow teams to procure the option of increasing initial draftee contracts and not impede further on a player's ability to move.","[('football', 'sport', 237, 245)]"

A survey was completed by 186 athletes (Mage = 37.5 years, 78.0% male, 45.1% wheelchair basketball) assessing norms, doping moral disengagement, anticipated guilt, and intentions to dope. Cluster analysis revealed four distinct subgroups of athletes, including one potentially high-risk subgroup characterized by relatively high scores on doping moral disengagement, subjective norms, and descriptive norms. One-way analysis of variance revealed significantly lower anticipated guilt in two athlete subgroups characterized by relatively higher doping moral disengagement than the other two subgroups. Moreover, the potentially high-risk group had a greater proportion of athletes showing some presence of intention to dope. This study suggests there is a small subgroup of disability-sport athletes at elevated risk of doping who might benefit from targeted antidoping interventions.","[('wheelchair basketball', 'sport', 292, 313)]"

Subsequently, we examined the dynamics of these matches using Social Network Analysis. We found that the opponent teams' performance levels did not influence the game dynamics. Notably, the eigenvector values were prominently higher for Attack Zones 2 and 4, wherein the middle-blocker jumped to attack close to the setter across all networks.

Some authors even suggest that practice circumvents the limits of working memory capacity (WMC) in skill acquisition. However, this circumvention hypothesis has been challenged recently by the evidence that WMC plays an important role in expert performance in complex domains such as arts and sports. Here, we have used two dynamic soccer tactical tasks to explore the effect of WMC on tactical performance at different levels of expertise. As expected, professional soccer players exhibited better tactical performance than amateur and recreational players. Furthermore, WMC predicted faster and more accurate tactical decisions in the task under auditory distraction and faster tactical decisions in the task without distraction. Importantly, lack of expertise × WMC interaction suggests that the WMC effect exists at all levels of expertise. Our results speak against the circumvention hypothesis and support a model of independent contributions of WMC and deliberate practice on expert performance in sports.","[('soccer', 'sport', 430, 436), ('soccer', 'sport', 565, 571)]"
37679121,An intelligent data analysis-based medical management method for lower limb health of football athletes.,"With increasingly mature commercial operations, football has become the most popular sport in the world. As the main body of football, athletes are prone to injury due to an increasing degree of competition intensity. Their health determines the length of these athletes careers, especially regarding the lower limbs that are mainly used. Therefore, the smart visualization approaches that can realize such function are in urgent demand in the area of sports healthcare. Benefitted by the strong ability of perception and analysis, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to construct an intelligent data analysis-based medical management method for the lower limb health of football athletes. First, the CNN is formulated as the main backbone, and its parameters are optimized for multiple rounds during the training stage. Then, a statistical analysis software named SPSS is introduced to assess the effect mechanism of different postures on lower limbs. Some experiments are carried out on simulative data to evaluate the proposed method, and results show a good performance of the proposed method.","[('football', 'sport', 48, 56), ('football', 'sport', 125, 133), ('football', 'sport', 684, 692)]"

Eleven NCAA Division I volleyball athletes performed countermovement vertical jumps with and without an arm swing prior to and immediately after a sport-specific training session. Each participant completed two jumps in each condition using a portable force platform. Paired samples t-tests were performed within each jump condition. When using an arm swing, mean braking force was the only variable to display a statistically significant change ( < 0.05). In the no-arm-swing condition, mean propulsive force, propulsive net impulse, jump height and reactive strength index modified all statistically increased ( < 0.05). Time to takeoff was statistically reduced ( < 0.05). Additionally, a single-subject analysis was performed across all eleven participants resulting in general trends seen in the no-arm-swing condition, whereas the arm-swing condition displayed inconsistent findings across participants.","[('volleyball', 'sport', 182, 192), ('volleyball', 'sport', 226, 236)]"

Qualitative focus groups were conducted across 30 participants (six facilitators, 14 Premier League academy players, and 10 SO players). Focus groups compared stakeholders' experiences of participating in a season-long inclusive football program. Three overarching higher order themes were generated, which highlighted positive outcomes from taking part. SO players provided endorsement for developing friendships and improving football skills, whereas academy players cited the positive impact that SO players had on their mood and motivation. Facilitators reflected on positive player outcomes and subsequent accomplishments. Overall, the findings indicated that this shared experience had psychosocial and football-specific benefits for everyone who participated.

37665850,The causal impacts of empty stadiums on women's sports activities: Evidence from European football leagues.,"This paper examines the effect of spectators on women's football games. COVID-19 and related restrictions provide a unique opportunity with an adequate sample size to test the effect of lockdown on sports activities. Studies have recently exploited this opportunity for men's football to better understand the potential causes of home advantage and, more specifically, assess the psychological consequences when matches are played without supporters. Despite the increased scientific interest, there was only one paper that focused on women's football. Therefore, we aim to contribute to this research field by considering matches from four major European women's football leagues. The findings suggest that for three of these leagues, lockdown has a statistically significant effect on the sanctioned yellow cards by either reducing the number of yellow cards sanctioned to the away teams or increasing the number of yellow cards sanctioned to the home teams. Nonetheless, lockdown does not affect any final match outcomes; therefore, it does not significantly affect the magnitude of home advantage for women's games.","[('football', 'sport', 56, 64), ('football', 'sport', 276, 284), ('football', 'sport', 543, 551), ('football', 'sport', 664, 672)]"

In total, 42 men's and 31 women's wheelchair basketball game videos were obtained from the official International Paralympic Committee. The videos were analyzed to assess the number of falls, playing time of the fall, playing phase, contact, foul judgment, fall location/direction, and the body part that first impacted the floor.A total of 1269 falls (men, n = 944; and women, n = 325) occurred. The analysis of men demonstrated significant differences in rounds, playing phase, location of fall, and body part first impacted. Women demonstrated significant differences in all categories except in rounds. Comparisons by functional impairment showed different trends for men and women.The detailed observation of videos suggested that men are more likely to have dangerous falls.

This study aimed to explore the current heading-related perspectives and behaviours of football stakeholders. In total, 290 players (aged over 11 years), 54 coaches, 34 non-coaching staff and 14 medical staff completed the survey. Of the 290 players, 56.5% reported being formally trained in heading, with female players less likely to be trained than male players ( < 0.05). Players were the least concerned about the long-term effects of heading, while medical staff were the most concerned (33.1% and 57.1%, respectively). From proposed strategies to reduce heading burden, a heading ban for all ages was least popular (2.3%), while teaching heading technique was most popular (67.3%). Our study provides insights into football stakeholders' heading-related perspectives, which could be used, along with scientific evidence, to inform pragmatic future heading guidelines.","[('football', 'sport', 178, 186), ('football', 'sport', 342, 350), ('football', 'sport', 977, 985)]"

Basketball activities lend themselves well for measurement by wrist-worn inertial sensors, and systems that are able to detect such sport-relevant activities could be used in applications of game analysis, guided training, and personal physical activity tracking. The dataset was recorded from two teams in separate countries (USA and Germany) with a total of 24 players who wore an inertial sensor on their wrist, during both a repetitive basketball training session and a game. Particular features of this dataset include an inherent variance through cultural differences in game rules and styles as the data was recorded in two countries, as well as different sport skill levels since the participants were heterogeneous in terms of prior basketball experience. We illustrate the dataset's features in several time-series analyses and report on a baseline classification performance study with two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.","[('basketball', 'sport', 143, 153), ('basketball', 'sport', 183, 193), ('basketball', 'sport', 623, 633), ('basketball', 'sport', 925, 935)]"

37730722,Bonitation assessment of intensively used football turf depending on the date and area of observation.,"This article aimed to evaluate the visual and functional characteristics of intensively used football turf over 10 years, depending on the different areas of the game. The research was conducted on the football turf of the AZS Environmental Club in Wrocław (N: 51° 7' 31'' E:17° 4' 14''). High variability of the evaluated parameters was observed regarding seasonality, year of observation, and the area of play. It has been shown that the goal area and penalty box areas have the lowest functional value, which are vital areas of the game from the point of view of gaining an advantage in the game. Also, these places are more susceptible to creating sites without plants (requiring additional overseeding) due to the potential of hollowing and goalkeeper interventions ending with the body landing on the ground. The middle area was characterized by the highest overall aspect, color, and turf density values. In the vast majority of cases, there was a downward trend in the turfs' functional value with the turf's age, which is an essential finding in the context of the use of intensively used, athletic natural grass surfaces.","[('football', 'sport', 93, 101), ('football', 'sport', 202, 210)]"
37192178,A color-related bias in offside judgments in professional soccer: A matter of figure-background contrast?,"We investigated the impact of outfit colors on the frequency of offside judgments in soccer. In a recent laboratory study, observers made more offside judgments against forwards wearing the outfit of Schalke 04 (blue shirts, white shorts) than against forwards wearing the outfit of Borussia Dortmund (yellow shirts, black shorts), when figure-background luminance contrast was higher for the former team. Here, we investigated whether a similar effect is present in real matches of the German Bundesliga. Study 1 revealed a higher offside score for Schalke 04 than for Borussia Dortmund in matches between these clubs. Studies 2-4 showed higher offside scores for teams wearing a blue/white outfit, and lower offside scores for teams wearing a yellow/black outfit, in their matches against all other Bundesliga teams. Together, results suggest that more offside judgments are made against teams of higher salience, possibly induced by differences in figure-background contrast. Notably, this color-related bias occurred in our study even though a Video-Assistant Referee (VAR) supervised the (offside) decisions of the Assistant Referees.","[('soccer', 'sport', 85, 91)]"

Match performance data were collected from the online database of the performance analysis company InStat.Results from a linear mixed model analysis showed that perceived mastery climate and extraversion were the only significant predictors of performance. Other relevant indicators, such as mental toughness, self-regulated learning, and grit, did not predict performance.These findings suggest that the team climate facilitated by coaches may be more important for predicting match performance than individual psychological factors.","[('football', 'sport', 106, 114), ('football', 'sport', 276, 284)]"
37205754,Early-life physical performance predicts the aging and death of elite athletes.,"Athleticism and the mortality rates begin a lifelong trajectory of decline during early adulthood. Because of the substantial follow-up time required, however, observing any longitudinal link between early-life physical declines and late-life mortality and aging remains largely inaccessible. Here, we use longitudinal data on elite athletes to reveal how early-life athletic performance predicts late-life mortality and aging in healthy male populations. Using data on over 10,000 baseball and basketball players, we calculate age at peak athleticism and rates of decline in athletic performance to predict late-life mortality patterns. Predictive capacity of these variables persists for decades after retirement, displays large effect sizes, and is independent of birth month, cohort, body mass index, and height. Furthermore, a nonparametric cohort-matching approach suggests that these mortality rate differences are associated with differential aging rates, not just extrinsic mortality. These results highlight the capacity of athletic data to predict late-life mortality, even across periods of substantial social and medical change.","[('baseball', 'sport', 482, 490), ('basketball', 'sport', 495, 505)]"

Ten healthy physical-education graduate students participated in this study. The biomechanical parameters during the jump rope training were collected by an AMTI force platform, a Novel Pedar-X insole and a wireless electromyography (EMG) system. The results of the force platform indicate that vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and contact time were much higher in the one-leg landing (both  = 0.001). The GRF, GRF (BW) and Lat MF pressure were significantly greater in the one-leg landing ( = 0.018, 0.013 and 0.027); the pressure of the Lat MF and H area were significantly greater in the volleyball shoe ( = 0.025, 0.031); the pressure of the Mid FF and Lat FF area were significantly greater in the jumping shoe ( = 0.005, 0.042). No significant difference in EMG was found between footwear and landing conditions. In summary, the running shoe and jumping shoe might be a better choice for people who exercise.

This study focused on analyzing HA and referee bias at different league levels. The study included 632 matches played in Turkey's top two leagues during the 2022-2023 season. Both leagues showed statistically significant game outcome differences between home and away teams regarding points, goals, shots, shots on target, passes, accurate passes, and ball possessions, indicating a HA. However, regarding referee bias, this study found that only Level 1 teams significantly differed in penalties and that this difference was not evident after analyzing for Bayes factors. Among Level 2 teams, as there was no statistical difference between home and away teams on any parameter indicating referee bias, and all Bayes factors indices were between 3.92-11.15, the null hypothesis was supported. Therefore, the results revealed a HA at both league levels, but a referee bias was not present in either league. This study emphasized that the HA phenomenon is clear and still evident in elite football and sub-elite leagues.","[('football', 'sport', 68, 76), ('soccer', 'sport', 78, 84), ('football', 'sport', 1121, 1129)]"

Results showed that the absence of crowds would reduce the home advantage of teams, but the findings varied by country. Most leagues have evidence that without the support of the spectators, their technical, tactical and physical performances would be worse. The referee seems likely to be fairer when the spectators are absent. Therefore, crowd supports is an important factor affecting home advantage, the clubs can at least try to strengthen the home advantage and increase the winning possibility by encouraging spectators to enter the stadium or reducing the ticket price.","[('soccer', 'sport', 429, 435)]"

While the two types of processes have mostly been studied separately, we sought to connect these lines of research by investigating the role of executive functions in soccer players' decision making from a developmental perspective. As these cognitive processes as well as their relation might differ between age groups, we took a developmental perspective to better understand this link in a sample of N = 128 soccer players (M = 10.69 years, SD = 1.44). Two age groups (younger vs. older players) performed a video-based option-generation and decision-making task that used temporal occlusion. Additionally, executive functions were assessed with standardized computer-based tests. Results show a link between executive functions and sport-specific decision making, most prominent for working memory. Further, older players generated better options and showed better inhibition and cognitive flexibility than younger players. We suggest there is a crucial turning point in cognitive development around the age of 11 years.","[('soccer', 'sport', 116, 122), ('soccer', 'sport', 308, 314), ('soccer', 'sport', 552, 558)]"

We conducted a multiple correspondence analysis in order to reduce six variables that are associated with skill and pressure to two dimensions that reflect our target concepts. Then, we used these two factors as independent variables in a logistic regression and fit different models using three binary dependent variables. The results show that high situational pressure significantly increases the probability of missing the goal entirely by about 6%, independent of the player's skill level. The probability that the goalkeeper saves a penalty significantly decreases by roughly 4% when a highly skilled player takes the shot. In general, high situational pressure decreases the probability of scoring a penalty kick. Furthermore, the probability to score a penalty increases if a highly skilled player takes the kick which indicates that a high skill level can act as a kind of buffer against debilitating effects caused by performance pressure.","[('football', 'sport', 109, 117)]"

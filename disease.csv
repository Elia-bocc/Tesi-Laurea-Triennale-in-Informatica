38267805,Long-Term Efficacy and Tolerability of PCSK9 Targeted Therapy: A Review of the Literature.,"Increased plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are causally associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and statins that lower LDL-C have been the cornerstone of ASCVD prevention for decades. However, guideline-recommended LDL-C targets are not achieved in about 60% of statin users. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)-targeted therapy effectively lowers LDL-C levels and has been shown to reduce ASCVD risk. A growing body of scientific and clinical evidence shows that PCSK9-targeted therapy offers an excellent safety and tolerability profile with a low incidence of side effects in the short term. In this review, we present and discuss the current clinical and scientific evidence pertaining to the long-term efficacy and tolerability of PCSK9-targeted therapy.","[('atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease', 'disease', 100, 138), ('ascvd', 'disease', 140, 145), ('ascvd', 'disease', 206, 211), ('ascvd', 'disease', 460, 465)]"
38269860,A Quantitative Analysis of Patient-Facing Technologies for Patient Self-Reporting.,"Dramatic improvements in patient-facing technologies have demonstrated the potential to transform healthcare delivery for a 360-degree holistic view of care. A key question regarding how such technologies affect patient self-reporting still needs to be answered. This study presents the technologies and their associated key variables via quantitative analysis. Associations were found between single-platform and web-based applications (apps), Android apps and physician view, mental health disease, and user feedback. The results are intended to inform future design, development, and evaluation of patient-facing technologies. More systematic, theory-driven, framework-based design and evaluation are necessary to fully characterize the effectiveness and maintenance of patient-facing technologies toward a sustainable strategy.","[('mental health disease', 'disease', 478, 499)]"

38265706,Host-Pathogen Interaction: Biology and Public Health.,"Interactions between host and pathogenic microorganisms are common in nature and have a significant impact on host health, often leading to several types of infections. These interactions have evolved as a result of the ongoing battle between the host's defense mechanisms and the pathogens' invasion strategies. In this chapter, we will explore the evolution of host-pathogen interactions, explore their molecular mechanisms, examine the different stages of interaction, and discuss the development of pharmacological treatments. Understanding these interactions is crucial for improving public health, as it enables us to develop effective strategies to prevent and control infectious diseases. By gaining insights into the intricate dynamics between pathogens and their hosts, we can work towards reducing the burden of such diseases on society.","[('infectious diseases', 'disease', 676, 695)]"

Common causes of RHF include pulmonary embolism, left heart failure, congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, acute myocardial infarction, infiltrative disease, infectious disease, and valvular abnormalities. Acute and chronic RHF confer a high risk for morbidity and mortality in the acute care setting, and interventions commonly used in emergency care can prompt acute decompensation if the RHF is not recognized. The severity of presentation may range from compensated clinically silent cardiovascular dysfunction to venous congestion, multiorgan failure, and circulatory collapse. This review describes the pathophysiology of right heart failure and offers an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis, management, and disposition of both acute and chronic RHF.","[('right heart failure', 'disease', 0, 19), ('rhf', 'disease', 21, 24), ('cardiac, pulmonary, and systemic pathologies', 'disease', 47, 91), ('rhf', 'disease', 110, 113), ('pulmonary embolism', 'disease', 122, 140), ('left heart failure', 'disease', 142, 160), ('congenital heart disease', 'disease', 162, 186), ('chronic lung disease', 'disease', 188, 208), ('acute myocardial infarction', 'disease', 210, 237), ('infiltrative disease', 'disease', 239, 259), ('infectious disease', 'disease', 261, 279), ('valvular abnormalities', 'disease', 285, 307), ('rhf', 'disease', 327, 330), ('rhf', 'disease', 494, 497), ('cardiovascular dysfunction', 'disease', 591, 617), ('multiorgan failure', 'disease', 640, 658), ('circulatory collapse', 'disease', 664, 684), ('right heart failure', 'disease', 731, 750), ('rhf', 'disease', 861, 864)]"
38269693,Designing a Digital Health Solution: A Platform for Automated Surveillance of Fungal Infection.,"Surveillance of invasive fungal infection (IFI) requires laborious review of multiple sources of clinical information, while applying complex criteria to effectively identify relevant infections. These processes can be automated using artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, including applying natural language processing (NLP) to clinical reports. However, developing a practically useful automated IFI surveillance tool requires consideration of the implementation context. We employed the Design Thinking Framework (DTF) to focus on the needs of end users of the tool to ensure sustained user engagement and enable its prospective validation. DTF allowed iterative generation of ideas and refinement of the final digital health solution. We believe this approach is key to increasing the likelihood that the solution will be implemented in clinical practice.","[('invasive fungal infection', 'disease', 16, 41), ('ifi', 'disease', 43, 46), ('ifi', 'disease', 404, 407)]"

38263463,Lithium carbonate revitalizes tumor-reactive CD8 T cells by shunting lactic acid into mitochondria.,"The steady flow of lactic acid (LA) from tumor cells to the extracellular space via the monocarboxylate transporter symport system suppresses antitumor T cell immunity. However, LA is a natural energy metabolite that can be oxidized in the mitochondria and could potentially stimulate T cells. Here we show that the lactate-lowering mood stabilizer lithium carbonate (LC) can inhibit LA-mediated CD8 T cell immunosuppression. Cytoplasmic LA increased the pumping of protons into lysosomes. LC interfered with vacuolar ATPase to block lysosomal acidification and rescue lysosomal diacylglycerol-PKCθ signaling to facilitate monocarboxylate transporter 1 localization to mitochondrial membranes, thus transporting LA into the mitochondria as an energy source for CD8 T cells. These findings indicate that targeting LA metabolism using LC could support cancer immunotherapy.","[('tumor', 'disease', 41, 46), ('cancer', 'disease', 850, 856)]"

Expanding on these, we report a proposita with intellectual disability and overgrowth and a novel de novo heterozygous PHF21A splice variant (NM_001352027.3:c.[153+1G>C];[=]) causing skipping of exon 6, which encodes an in-frame BHC80 deletion (p.(Asn30_Gln51del)). This deletion disrupts a predicted leucine zipper domain and implicates this domain in BHC80 function and as a target of variation causing PHF21A-related NDDs.

38268831,Molecular crosstalk between circadian clock and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Research has recently found that both animal models and patients with PD have circadian dysfunction, accompanied by abnormal expression of circadian genes and proteins, which implies that the circadian clock plays a crucial role in PD etiopathogenesis. In addition, a strong relationship between NLRP3 inflammasome signaling and PD has been observed. Meanwhile, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is highly relevant to dysfunctions of the molecular clock. Therefore, alleviating the neuroinflammation caused by NLRP3 inflammasome signaling by adjusting the abnormal molecular clock may be a potential strategy for preventing and treating PD.

As one of gas signaling molecules, carbon monoxide (CO) has been proved to exert anti-cancer effects via triggering multiple cell death types, such as autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis. Here, we showed that low concentration CO delivered from CO-releasing molecule 3 (CORM-3) effectively induced ferroptosis, known as a novel proinflammatory programmed cell death, in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that CO triggered ferroptosis by modulating the ROS/GSK3β/GPX4 signaling pathway, resulting in the accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides and the occurrence of ferroptosis. We think our findings provide novel insights into the anti-cancer mechanisms of CO, and suggest that CO could potentially be exploited as a novel ferroptosis inducer for cancer treatment in the future.","[('cancer', 'disease', 92, 98), ('cancer', 'disease', 854, 860)]"

In contrast, this process is reversed by deubiquitinases (DUBs), which remove ubiquitin from ubiquitinated substrates. Dysregulation of DUBs is associated with several human diseases, such as cancer, inflammation, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases. Thus, DUBs have become promising targets for drug development. Although the physiological and pathological effects of DUBs are increasingly well understood, the clinical drug discovery of selective DUB inhibitors has been challenging.

Mechanistically, ADAM9 loss increases the interaction of KRAS with plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which functions as a selective autophagy receptor in conjunction with light chain 3 (LC3), triggering lysosomal degradation of KRAS. Suppression of ADAM9 by a small-molecule inhibitor restricts disease progression in spontaneous models, and combination with gemcitabine elicits dramatic regression of patient-derived tumors.

38262838,Glycosylation in malaria parasites: what do we know?,"In malaria parasites, although post-translational modification of proteins with N-. O-, and C-glycosidic bond-linked glycans is limited, it is confined to relatively fewer proteins in which the glycans are present at significant levels and may have important functions. Furthermore, several proteins are modified with glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) which represent the predominant glycan synthesized by parasites. Modification of proteins with GPIs is obligatory for parasite survival as GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) play essential roles in all life cycle stages of the parasites, including development, egress, gametogenesis, motility, and host cell adhesion and invasion. Here, we discuss the current knowledge on the structures and potential functions of the glycan moieties of parasite proteins. The knowledge has important implications for the development of drugs and vaccines for malaria.","[('malaria', 'disease', 3, 10), ('malaria', 'disease', 896, 903)]"
